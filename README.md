## You Won't Believe What Candidates Did On This Technical Test

### Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
This is the coding test I've been using for almost a year now.
I'm updating it,
so I thought it could be interesting to share it with the World™.
We all know about the technical tests at big tech companies. But I guess it could also
be interesting to see how it works for small startups.

This has been my first experience as a Lead Front (and as a hiring manager) hence I'm not pretending here
to have created the best test ever. But at least
Le Test is drawn from my experience being interviewed at 10+ companies (big and small) in the past.

Establishing this extra step in the hiring process was controversial in the beginning for all the usual reasons:
- Good candidates can fail tests
- Bad candidates can pass tests
- blablabla

Instead of debating for 3 months, we tried it and we've been quite happy with it so far.

I think it's important to have your *own* test and not get one from THE internets because
the process of writing it helps you think about what you really want from candidates.

you've got too much time on your hands!

### Some bullet points for people who don't like prose

#### For which company?

- It's called WorkAngel, we build an employee engagement platform.
- It's a tech company (around 70 people at the time of commiting).
- I'm in charge of the Web Team.
- Javascript is our main technology.

#### Why a test?

- We need good Front-End engineers for the Web Team.
- We needed a way to efficiently filter out candidates that weren't technically good enough.
- We didn't want a 4-hour test (because we already had one as an extra step of the process – if needed)
- We wanted something that resembled big tech companies' tests (because they must be doing it for a reason)
- But easier (because pragmatism never hurts)

#### Live coding vs debriefing afterwards?

I did both.
I prefer putting people in a room and asking them questions after. Because it's less stressful.
But when I was interviewing candidates from foreign countries a live google doc editing over Skype worked as well.

#### Results?

This ended up being a 20-minute pencil&paper test consisting of 10 questions on practical JavaScript fundamentals.

As for how the candidates performed, nothing surprising here:
No matter how hard you're trying, you cannot fight against Carl Friedrich and his [Gaussian distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)!

#### Why updating it?

ES6 is here.
