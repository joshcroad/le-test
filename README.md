:wip:

This is the coding test I've been using for almost a year now.
I'm updating it,
so I thought it could be interesting to share it with the World™.

For which company?

- It's called WorkAngel, we build an employee engagement platform.
- It's a tech company.
- We need good Front-End engineers for the Web Team.
- Javascript is our main technology.

Why a test?

- We needed a way to efficiently filter out candidates that weren't technically good enough.
- We didn't want a 4-hour test (because we already had one as the last step of the process)
- We wanted something that resembled big tech companies' tests (because they must be doing it for a reason)
- But easier (because pragmatism never hurts)

Live coding vs debriefing afterwards?

I did both.
I prefer putting people in a room and asking them questions after. Because it's less stressful.
But when I was interviewing candidates from foreign countries a live google doc editing over Skype worked.

Results?

Wèèè!

Why updating it?

Fatigue.
